# Basic Scripts

## Ù‘Itroduction

Usually in scripting, there are a series of functions or lists of variables and commands that are used a lot, such as: 
- progress bars 
- locking the script file during execution 
- printing in color
- etc

I'm going to create a collection of them so I don't have to write them from scratch every time in my scripts and put that collection into this repo.

## List of contents:
